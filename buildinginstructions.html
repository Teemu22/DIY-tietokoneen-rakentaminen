<p> Let's start building your computer! We'll guide you step by step on what to do. You can also watch a PC building video online at the same time if it helps you to see things visually. Now, we recommend you take it easy, building a computer isn't rocket science. Put on some relaxing music and let's get started!</p><br>

<ul>
<p>üß∞ <b>Required Tools and Materials:</b> </p>
<li>Phillips-head screwdriver</li>
<li>Anti-static wrist strap (recommended, but not mandatory)</li>
<li>A good workspace</li>
<li>All PC components + USB stick with the operating system pre-loaded (you can download the OS from another computer with an activated operating system, or order a USB installation stick from an online store if you don't have another computer)</li>
</ul>
________________________________________<br>
<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step Assembly Instructions:</h2><br>
<p>1. Prepare your workspace and unpack the components
‚Ä¢	Lay out all parts and make sure everything you need is present.</p>
________________________________________<br>
<p>2. Install the power supply into the case
‚Ä¢	Place the power supply unit (PSU) into position (usually at the bottom of the case), with the fan facing either up or down depending on airflow.
‚Ä¢	Screw it into place using the screws that came with it.</p>
________________________________________<br>
<p>3. Prepare the motherboard
‚Ä¢	Place the motherboard on an anti-static surface if possible.
‚Ä¢	Install the processor (CPU) carefully:
o	Open the CPU socket.
o	Align the triangle on the CPU with the triangle on the socket.
o	Gently place the CPU into position and close the socket latch.
‚Ä¢	Add thermal paste if the cooler doesn't already have it pre-applied.
‚Ä¢	Install the CPU cooler according to the manual (included in the cooler box).
‚Ä¢	Connect the CPU cooler fan to the CPU_FAN header on the motherboard.</p>
________________________________________<br>
<p>4. Install the memory (RAM)
‚Ä¢	Open the clips on the RAM slots.
‚Ä¢	Align the RAM sticks properly and press them down firmly until they click into place.</p>
________________________________________<br>
<p>5. Install storage drives
‚Ä¢	Install your SSD or HDD in the case‚Äôs drive bays or in the M.2 slot on the motherboard (if using an M.2 SSD).
‚Ä¢	Secure with screws if necessary (depending on the case).
‚Ä¢	If using 2.5" or 3.5" drives, remember to connect the SATA data cable and power cable later. (These drives are typically mounted under the back panel of the case.)</p>
________________________________________<br>
<p>6. Install the motherboard into the case
‚Ä¢	Insert the I/O shield (back panel plate) into the case.
‚Ä¢	Align the motherboard with the standoffs and screw it into place.</p>
________________________________________<br>
<p>7. Connect power cables
‚Ä¢	Plug the 24-pin ATX power cable into the motherboard.
‚Ä¢	Plug the 8-pin CPU power cable into the top of the motherboard.
‚Ä¢	Connect power cables to any storage drives (M.2 drives don‚Äôt require power cables).</p>
________________________________________<br>
<p>8. Install the graphics card (GPU)
‚Ä¢	Open the PCIe slot and remove the necessary I/O shield covers from the back of the case.
‚Ä¢	Insert the GPU and secure it with screws.
‚Ä¢	Connect the necessary power cables from the power supply to the GPU.</p>
________________________________________<br>
<p>9. Connect the front panel connectors (power button, USB, audio, etc.)
‚Ä¢	Refer to your motherboard manual to see exactly where each cable goes.
‚Ä¢	Connect the power button, reset button, front panel USB ports, and audio jacks.</p>
________________________________________<br>
<p>10. Check cable management and tidy up
‚Ä¢	Use cable ties or straps to tidy up cables and route them behind the motherboard tray.
‚Ä¢	Make sure no cables block any fans.</p>
________________________________________<br>
<p>11. First boot and BIOS
‚Ä¢	Connect a monitor, keyboard, and power cable.
‚Ä¢	Power on the computer.
‚Ä¢	Enter BIOS (usually by pressing DEL, F2, or ESC during boot).
‚Ä¢	Check that the CPU, RAM, SSD, and other components are detected.
‚Ä¢	Update BIOS if needed (follow instructions from the motherboard manufacturer's website).</p>
________________________________________<br>
<p>12. Install the operating system (Windows/Linux/macOS)
‚Ä¢	Load the OS onto a USB stick.
‚Ä¢	Boot from the USB and follow the on-screen instructions to install the operating system.
