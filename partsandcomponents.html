    <p>First, you need to decide what level of gaming machine you want to build. The quality of the parts doesn’t have much impact on the difficulty of assembling the machine, so the most important thing when selecting parts is defining your budget.

    Let’s first go through what each part does.</p> <br>

    <h2>GPU</h2>

<p>The graphics card, or GPU (Graphics Processing Unit), is the central component of a gaming machine, especially when it comes to gaming with high graphics settings and smooth frame rates. It is responsible for the visual performance of games—such as lighting, shadows, textures, and resolution—and directly affects how the game looks and how smoothly it runs. The GPU typically takes up about half of the machine’s budget, so don’t be alarmed by high prices when browsing GPU options.</p> <br>

<h2>CPU</h2>

<p>Next, you select the processor, or CPU (Central Processing Unit), which directly affects how well the machine can handle complex computing tasks and the latest games, alongside the GPU. Pay special attention to the CPU choice if you’re also planning for other heavy tasks, like video editing or streaming.</p> <br>

RAM

Memory, or RAM (Random Access Memory), is the third key component. For gaming, at least 16GB of RAM is recommended these days to ensure that games and background applications run smoothly.

Motherboard

The motherboard connects all of these parts together. The most important factor in choosing a motherboard is its compatibility with other components. The motherboard's features, such as ports, memory capacity, and potential support for overclocking, affect the machine's expandability and performance in the future.

PSU

The power supply unit (PSU) ensures that all components receive sufficient power. A high-quality and adequately powerful PSU is crucial for a stable and safe build. Power recommendations depend on the power consumption of the GPU and CPU, among other factors.

Storage

Storage determines how much space you have for games, programs, and files on your gaming machine—but just as important is the speed of the storage solution. Today, SSDs (Solid State Drives) are the standard choice for gaming machines as they provide significantly faster load times compared to traditional hard drives (HDDs).

Case and Cooling

Finally, you select the case and cooling solutions. The case needs to be spacious and well-ventilated to ensure that all parts fit and stay cool. Air or liquid cooling systems prevent components from overheating and improve the machine's lifespan.

Once all the parts are chosen and purchased, the assembly process is fairly straightforward, especially if you follow the instructions and work in a calm environment. Building a gaming machine is not only cost-effective but also rewarding—the end result is a device tailored specifically to your needs and budget. Below, we’ll also provide ready-made options, from which you can choose the setup that suits your budget.
