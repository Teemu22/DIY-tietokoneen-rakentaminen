<p> Hello there! My name is Aleksi, and I'd like to warmly welcome you to our DIY-PC building website!
    During my renowned PC-building career, I have had the pleasure of being a part of the birth of two PC-builds.
    The first project I took part in, was my brothers PC, which I built all by myself.
    The second project was my own PC, which I also built by myself, and it very much is my pride and joy. 
    Although I have only been using my PC for a short time, I am sure that, thanks to my knowledge, it will serve me for many years to come.
    I am also sure that my expertise and know-how will serve you well, and together we will complete your dream PC-build from start to finish!
</p>
